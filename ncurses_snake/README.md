# Overview

Simple Snake clone Game using the ncurses library

to compile and run, the game use the following command:
``` ./compile.sh && ./a.out ```

Movements: 
* 'h' -> turn left
* 'l' -> turn right (lowercase 'L' but dunno why on github this looks like a
  simple I character)

NOTE: the character 'f' is the food to feast on and grow larger WHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
